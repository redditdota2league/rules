# SEAL Dota Season 1 Rules

## *How it works*

### 1. How Teams Form

* Prior to the season, individuals sign up as a captain, player, free agent, or standin - this is not a league for pre-made teams.
* All signups must be vouched by an admin for conduct and activity.
* Captains select 5 other players for their team in a player draft on the first Sunday of the season:
		1. Captains are seeded into a preliminary draft order roughly based on MMR (Lowest to highest).
		2. After each round, the draft order is revised - the average MMR of the team drafted up to that point is used (lowest to highest).
* During the season, any players who leave a team or have inconsistent attendance will be replaced by a free agent of similar MMR.
### 2. Regular Season

* The regular season is 8 weeks long, with a captain’s mode bo2 each week.
* Matches are to begin by 7pm Pacific Time each Sunday.
* Matches may be rescheduled to a different time or day if both captains agree.
* Teams will be matched against other teams that have a similar record each week.

### 3. Post Season

* Teams will be seeded (based on regular season play) into 4 team bo3 brackets for 1st, 5th, 9th, etc.
* There will be two weeks of play for each team.
* For example, the two teams that lose first round in the 1st place bracket will play for 3rd place.

## *Rules*

### 1. Eligibility

* Participants must sign up with their main account. This account may not be used by any other player for the duration of the season.
* Participants must alert the admins if their MMR may not accurately reflect their skill level.
* Accounts must have at least 10 dota games (excluding Ability Draft) in the month before draft day recorded on Dotabuff.
* For Season 1, all participants must be vouched by an admin for activity and behavior.
* Nobody should expect to miss more than 3 weeks in the season (including playoffs).
		1. If players expect inconsistent attendance for an upcoming season, they are encouraged to instead sign up as a standin or free agent, as appropriate.
* Nobody should be more cancerous than Aeosynth (he is the floor).

### 2. Participation

* Every player on a team’s roster must play in at least 1 game of the bo2 each week, if available.

### 3. Player Trades

* With approval from both captains, both players?, and the admins, players may be traded between teams within the first two weeks after the draft.

### 4. Games

* All games are to be played on the USW server and in Captains Mode, hosted by one of the captains on the SEAL ticket
* Games must start on time - below are the penalties for being late:
	* 8:05pm or later - Level 1 draft penalty
	* 8:10pm or later - Level 2 draft penalty
	* 8:15pm or later - Level 3 draft penalty
	* 8:20pm or later - Forfeit both games
* If both captains agree on a different start time or date, these same penalties apply to the agreed-upon match time.
* Each team is allowed 10 minutes of pause time per game.
* All chat is allowed, unless either captain requests no all chat.
	* All chat is always allowed for purpose of calling GG.
* The “Away” team (listed second in the matchups) has choice of side or pick in game 1 and the “Home” team has choice of side or pick in game 2.
* Teams are not allowed to “stream cheat” in any way - no player currently in a game may view a stream of the game, spectate the game, or communicate with anyone doing so.
* Team members not playing are permitted to be in a caster slot in the lobby, but are not allowed to communicate with the team.

### 5. Standins

* A standin may be used to replace any player unable to attend a match each week.
* Only one player may be replaced per match - if a team is incapable of fielding at least 4 players from their roster, they automatically forfeit their match.
* Each standin must be of an MMR equal to or lower than the player they are replacing, as listed in the Adjusted MMR tab from the draft sheet.

### 6. Free Agents

* Free agents may be assigned by the admins with the following priority (assuming MMR is similar to the player being replaced):
	* Players left over from the draft/signed up as free agents prior to the season.
	* Players from disbanded teams that were not the cause of the disband.
	* Players that signed up as free agents during the season.

### 7. Conduct

* Flaming is part of DOTA2, but repeated conduct (in games, discord, subreddit, or anywhere) that violates the below standards may result in removal from the league:
	* No hate speech (speech which attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender)
	* No cyber-bullying (for example, repeatedly telling someone to kill themselves)
	* No tactical fake GG calls (BM fake GG calls are allowed)

### 8. Postseason

* Teams will be seeded into 4-team brackets based on the following:
	* W-L record
	* Strength of schedule
	* Number of standins used (fewer is better)

### 9. Additional Circumstances

* If a majority of the admins approve, any action may be taken and will be accompanied by a subreddit post outlining the action and reasoning.
